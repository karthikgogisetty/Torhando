# ü§ñ TorHando Robotics Project

TorHando is a modular, multi-platform robotics framework designed to integrate and simulate real-world robot behaviors using ROS, Gazebo, TurtleBot3, RPi4, Arduino, Blender, and CAD tools. It is built to explore different levels of robot autonomy ‚Äî from direct control (Level 0) to full autonomy (Level 5) ‚Äî through simulations and hardware prototypes.

## üß† Key Highlights

- **Level 2 & 4 Autonomy Implementations** in simulation and code.
- **PI/PID Controllers** for motion control via `/cmd_vel` and `/odom`.
- **Telegram Bot Integration** with Raspberry Pi for IoT-like control.
- **Move_base + DWA Planning** for obstacle navigation and trajectory planning.
- **URDF, Gazebo Worlds, RViz configs**, and costmap params for full-stack robot simulation.

## üóÇ ROS Submodules

Explore core ROS logic and models inside the main workspace:

- `ROS Files/turtle_sim_ws/src/kobuki_description`
- `ROS Files/turtle_sim_ws/src/torhando`
- `ROS Files/turtle_sim_ws/src/turtlebot_navigation`
- `ROS Files/turtle_sim_ws/src/turtlebot_description`

Each has its own launch files, URDFs, and controller nodes.
